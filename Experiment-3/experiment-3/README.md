React Portfolio Website
Project Overview

This project is an extension of Experiment 2. It expands the original single-page React application into a multi-page application using React Router.

The website follows a portfolio theme, where the Home page introduces the developer and the Projects page showcases sample work. The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate page navigation, structured content organization, and consistent UI design in a React application.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Create multiple pages in a React application

Use React Router to enable navigation between pages

Maintain consistent UI/UX design across pages

Extend the first webpage with additional relevant content

Project Description

This portfolio website consists of two main pages:

Home Page

The Home page acts as an introduction section. It provides:

A welcome message

A short description of the developer

A clean and simple layout

This page represents the primary landing page of the website.

 Projects Page

The Projects page extends the functionality of the website by:

Displaying project information

Organizing content in a structured format

Maintaining consistent design with the Home page

Each project is presented clearly to showcase the developer’s work and skills.

Navigation

Navigation between pages is handled using React Router.

A navigation bar is placed at the top of the website

Users can switch between Home and Projects without reloading the page

The application behaves like a single-page application (SPA)

This improves user experience and makes the website dynamic.

UI & Design

The website maintains a consistent design across all pages by:

Using uniform spacing and padding

Applying consistent color themes

Keeping layout structure simple and clean

Ensuring readability and user-friendly navigation

The design focuses on clarity and simplicity.
